# 1v1 Star Wars Combat Game
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yth3zBW6i4M
#### Description: 
This is a game built in Unity with C# that is a simple 1v1 lightsaber fighting game. It features attack combos, blocking, various animations/animation states, and a functioning enemy AI!
Within this project there are multiple different folders containing important aspects of the game including:
- Scripts
- Scenes
- Animation

The Scripts folder contains all the written code to make the game function. There are scripts for player/enemy movement, managing animation state, handling damage, and more. The Scenes folder contains the main scene where most of the game takes place as well as the Start scene. I did not spend much time on creating a good looking scene because there is no coding involved in that and wanted to focus on the coding portion for this final project. Finally, the animation folder holds all the animations used in the game, animation controllers to control which animation is played, and a Unity feature called Masks which allows for manipulation of body parts during certain animations. I intend to continue working on this game to flush it out and make it much more smooth in the future.
